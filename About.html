                <p>Welcome to Melody’s Wool 
                <br><br> 
                Port Elizabeth’s cozy corner for creativity, comfort, and community.
                Nestled in the heart of the Bay, Melody’s Wool shoppe is more than just a shop, it’s a place where warmth and imagination come 
                together, one stitch at a time. Whether you’re an experienced crafter or just picking up your first set of needles, you’ll 
                find inspiration in every color, texture, and skein on our shelves. Our shop began as a small dream in Melody’s family living 
                room. 
                <br><br>
                Melody, a lifelong knitter and mother of two, started crocheting scarves and blankets for neighbors during a particularly 
                chilly Eastern Cape winter. Word spread fast, not just about her skill, but about the laughter, tea, and kindness that always came 
                with every bundle of yarn. Soon, her hobby turned into a heartfelt business, and Melody’s Wool was born. 
                <br><br>
                Today, we carry all kinds of wool and yarns, from soft baby pastels to chunky winter blends, along with knitting needles, patterns, 
                and accessories to bring your ideas to life. But what truly makes us special is our community — families, friends, and crafters of 
                all ages who stop by not just to shop, but to share stories, learn something new, and leave a little happier.At Melody’s Wool, we 
                believe every thread has a story — and we’d love to be part of yours.
